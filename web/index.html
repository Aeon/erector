== DESCRIPTION

Erector is a Builder-like view framework, inspired by Markaby but overcoming
some of its flaws. In Erector all views are objects, not template files,
which allows the full power of object-oriented programming (inheritance,
modular decomposition, encapsulation) in views.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

While Erector is in use on several projects, it is still at a relatively
early stage.  In particular, not all features are documented (although
the most important ones are).  

== SYNOPSIS

    require 'erector'

    class Hello &lt; Erector::Widget
      def render
        div do
          text &quot;Hello!&quot;
        end
      end
    end

== REQUIREMENTS

The gem depends on hoe and rake, although this is just for building
erector (those who just use erector won't need these).

== INSTALL

To install as a gem:

* sudo gem install erector

Then add &quot;require 'erector'&quot; to any files which need erector.

To install as a Rails plugin:

* Copy the erector source to vendor/plugins/erector in your Rails directory.

When installing this way, erector is automatically available to your Rails code
(no require directive is needed).

== MOTIVATION

Why use Erector? This section will soon become a real essay or blog post,
but briefly:

* Markaby-style DOM Domain language
* Your views are real classes, written in a real language, allowing
  * Functional decomposition
  * Inheritance
  * Composition, not partials
  * Well-defined semantics for variables, loops, blocks
  * Dependency injection via constructor params
* As little magic as possible (e.g. no automagic copying of &quot;assigns&quot; variable from your controller)
* yield works again (Markaby broke it)
* Very testable
* form_for ERB code is craaaaazy (not to mention the quagmire of options vs. htmloptions)
* Output is streamed, improving performance over string copy


== USER DOCUMENTATION

The basic way to construct some HTML/XML with erector is to 
subclass Erector::Widget and implement a render method:

  class Hello &lt; Erector::Widget
    def render
      html do
        head do
          title &quot;Hello&quot;
        end
        body do
          text &quot;Hello, &quot;
          b &quot;world!&quot;
        end
      end
    end
  end
  Hello.new.to_s  
  #=&gt; &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello, &lt;b&gt;world!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
  
Here are the basics:

  element('foo')           # &lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;
  empty_element('foo')     # &lt;foo /&gt;
  html                     # &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; (likewise for other common html tags)
  b &quot;foo&quot;                  # &lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;
  text 'foo'               # foo
  text '&amp;&lt;&gt;'               # &amp;amp;&amp;lt;&amp;gt; (what you generally want, especially
                           # if the text came from the user or a database)
  text raw('&amp;&lt;&gt;')          # &amp;&lt;&gt; (back door for raw html)
  rawtext('&amp;&lt;&gt;')           # &amp;&lt;&gt; (alias for text(raw()))
  html { text foo }        # &lt;html&gt;foo&lt;/html&gt;
  html &quot;foo&quot;               # &lt;html&gt;foo&lt;/html&gt;
  html foo                 # &lt;html&gt;bar&lt;/html&gt; (if the method foo returns the string &quot;bar&quot;)
  a(:href =&gt; 'foo.html')   # &lt;a href=&quot;foo.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  a(:href =&gt; 'q?a&amp;b')      # &lt;a href=&quot;q?a&amp;amp;b&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  (quotes as for text)
  a(:href =&gt; raw('&amp;amp;')) # &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  text nbsp(&quot;Save Doc&quot;)    # Save&amp;#160;Doc (turns spaces into non-breaking spaces)
  instruct                 # &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

TODO: document more obscure features like capture, Table, :class =&gt; ['one', 'two']

=== Using Erector from Ruby on Rails

Your views are just ruby classes.  Your controller instantiates the relevant view and calls render.
For example:

app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb:

  class WelcomeController &lt; ApplicationController

    def index
      render :template =&gt; 'welcome/show'
    end

  end

app/views/welcome/show.rb:

  class Views::Welcome::Show &lt; Erector::Widget

    def render
      html do
        head do
          title &quot;Welcome page&quot;
        end
      
        body do
          p &quot;Hello, world&quot;
        end
      end
    end
  
  end

For Rails to find these .rb files during render, you must first either copy the erector source to
vendor/plugins/erector, or add `require 'erector'` to config/environment.rb. You also should delete (or rename) 
any other view files with the same base name that might be getting in the way.

=== Erect

To make Rails integration as smooth as possible, we've written a little tool that will help you
erect your existing Rails app. The &quot;erect&quot; tool will convert HTML or HTML/ERB into an Erector class.
It ships as part of the Erector gem, so to try it out, install the gem, then run

    erect app/views/foos/*.html.erb

or just

    erect app/views
    
and then delete the original files when you're satisfied.

Here's a little command-line howto for erecting a scaffold Rails app:

    rails foo
    cd foo
    script/generate scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean

    erect app/views/posts/*.erb

    mate app/views/posts
    sleep 30 # this should be enough time for you to stop drooling
    rm app/views/posts/*.erb
    (echo &quot;&quot;; echo &quot;require 'erector'&quot;) &gt;&gt; config/environment.rb
    rake db:migrate
    script/server
    open http://localhost:3000/posts

=== Layout Inheritance

Erector replaces the typical Rails layout mechanism with a more natural construct, the use of inheritance. Want a common
layout? Just implement a layout superclass and inherit from it. Implement render in the superclass and implement template
methods in its subclasses. There's one trick you'll need to use this layout for non-erector templates. Here's an example.

`application.rb` - The Erector layout superclass

    class Views::Layouts::Application &lt; Erector::Widget
      attr_accessor :content

      def render
        html do
          head { } # head content here
          # body content here
          body do
            text content
          end
        end
      end
    end

`application.mab` - The markaby template (adjust for other appropriately templating technologies)

    widget = Views::Layouts::Application.new(self)
    widget.content = content_for_layout
    self &lt;&lt; widget.to_s

Here the abstract layout widget is used in a concrete fashion by the template-based layout. Normally, the `content` method
would be implemented by subclassing widgets, but the layout template sets it directly and then calls to_s on the layout widget.
This allows the same layout to be shared in a backward compatible way.

=== Other ways to call erector

Instead of subclassing Erector::Widget and implementing a render
method, you can pass a block to Erector::Widget.new.  For example:

  html = Erector::Widget.new do
    p &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
  end
  html.to_s          #=&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;

This lets you define mini-widgets on the fly.

== DEVELOPER NOTES

* Check out project from rubyforge: 

  svn co svn+ssh://developername@rubyforge.org/var/svn/erector/trunk erector

* Install gems:

  sudo gem install rake rails rspec rubyforge hpricot treetop

* Run specs:

  rake

* Check out the available rake tasks:

  rake -T


=== VERSIONING POLICY

* Versions are of the form major.minor.tiny
* Tiny revisions fix bugs or documentation
* Tiny revisions are roughly equal to the svn revision number when they were made
* Minor revisions add API calls, or change behavior
* Minor revisions may also remove API calls, but these must be clearly announced in History.txt, with instructions on how to migrate 
* Major revisions are about marketing more than technical needs. We will stay in major version 0 until we're happy taking the &quot;alpha&quot; label off it. And if we ever do a major overhaul of the API, especially one that breaks backwards compatibility, we will probably want to increment the major version.
* We will not be shy about incrementing version numbers -- if we end up going to version 0.943.67454 then so be it.
* Developers should attempt to add lines in History.txt to reflect their checkins. These should reflect feature-level changes, not just one line per checkin. The top section of History.txt is used as the Release Notes by the &quot;rake publish&quot; task and will appear on the RubyForge file page.
* Someone making a release must fill in the version number in History.txt as well as in Rakefile. Note that &quot;rake release&quot; requires a &quot;VERSION=1.2.3&quot; parameter to confirm you're releasing the version you intend.
* As soon as a release is made and published, the publisher should go into History.txt and make a new section. Since we won't yet know what the next version will be called, the new section will be noted by a single &quot;===&quot; at the top of the file.
